*Each measurement file has the following format for its name:

year-month-day-hour-minutes-seconds-microseconds-PDPs.npy


*The file can be loaded as an NumPy variable. The Numpy variable
has the following 3 dimensions (in the following order):

1st dimension: time snapshot index
2nd dimension: beam index
3rd dimension: 'delay' index

*The 2nd dimension's size is 64 and corresponds to the following angles:


*The 3rd dimension's size is 1024


*Each time snapshot duration corresponds to an average time of 150 ms (80-150 ms)


*In a measurement there might be multiple files recorded. They are recorded sequentially,
one right after the other (with no pause)
